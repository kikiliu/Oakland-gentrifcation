============

Crime Data Notebook: This data set is a good starting point to our project because it has information with lat/long coordinates, which I will be using to generate census-tracts buckets, and use the same buckets to sort not only the crime data (and aggregate it) but also the housing data managed and cleaned by Kiki. So far I have managed to clean the data, there are more steps in which I aggregate it, and experiment the many possibilities in which I can later on display it. The next step after producing the buckets and aggregating it would be to display it using a Google map, something that I have been working on simultaniously. Also, D3 is another path that I have been looking at. It seems like most of the data we have will make more sense once it is layered and resides within a single map.
